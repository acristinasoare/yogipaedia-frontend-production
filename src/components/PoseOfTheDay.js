          Yoga is a holistic practice that originated in ancient India and
          encompases physical postures, breathing exercises, meditation, and
          ethical principles. It is a discipline aimed at promoting physical,
          mental, and spiritual well-being. Through the practice of yoga,
          individuals can improve flexibility, strength, and balance, while also
          reducing stress, enhancing mental clarity and fostering a sense of
          inner peace. Whether you are a beginner yogi or an aspiring yoga
          teacher, you can explore a variety of yoga poses by using the
